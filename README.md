The app's sliding carousel leverages the power and simplicity of jQuery's DOM manipulation for its sliding movement. On hover, each of the slides inside the carousel expand to show more information about that slide's video. This expanding effect is achieved through the CSS ':hover' selector.


### Single Expanding Block for Each Carousel

### Adding Videos to 'My List'
Each Bingeflix user has a 'My List' to which they can add and from which they can delete videos. Adding videos to one's list is as simple as clicking on the '+' icon on the video's expanding block.
