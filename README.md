# README
Bingeflix allows users to create accounts, stream videos, search through available videos, and add videos they would like to watch to their 'My List'. This app was built using a React/Redux front-end and a Rails back-end.

I created the app's sliding carousels by leveraging the power and simplicity of jQuery's DOM manipulation.

### Adding Videos to 'My List'
Each Bingeflix user has a 'My List' to which they can add and from which they can delete videos. Adding videos to one's list is as simple as clicking on the '+' icon on the video's expanding block.
